    <h1>Welcome to Z5 Video Annotator</h1>
    <p>The video annotation tool does the following things so that the annotation and collaboration is seamless.</p>

    <p>
        1. Sync'd playback for everyone : The annotation tool should allow everyone online i.e. the people whom you are trying to collaborate , to view videos in sync. So when you play, pause or jump to anywhere in the video, everyone should be able to see what
        you see. </p>
    <p>
        2. Frame-by-frame review : If you need to really need to dive deep, you should be able to progress through the video on a frame level accurately. Needless to say, frames should be sync'd across everyone online as well.</p>
    <p>
        3. You should be able to draw, annotate, comment to suggest changes and give feedback on top of frames.
